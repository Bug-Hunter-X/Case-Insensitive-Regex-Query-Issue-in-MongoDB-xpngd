# Case-Insensitive Regex Query Issue in MongoDB

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using case-insensitive regular expressions in MongoDB queries.  The original code uses the `i` flag with the `$regex` operator, but fails to return all matching documents due to a misunderstanding of how the `i` flag works within the context of the MongoDB query engine.  The solution provides an alternative approach that correctly handles case-insensitive matching.

## Problem Description

The original code attempts to retrieve documents from the `myCollection` where the `field` matches a specific pattern, case-insensitively. It uses the `i` flag to enable case-insensitive matching, but may still fail to return all expected documents. This might occur if the underlying MongoDB version or driver does not fully support case insensitivity as expected.

## Solution

The improved code ensures case-insensitive matching. It might involve explicit case conversion to lowercase before comparing, ensuring the query reliably returns all relevant documents regardless of the case of the field values.
